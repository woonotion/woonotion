# Best WooCommerce Snippets
A collection of WooCommerce PHP snippets written by me for adding more functionality to your online store. All of these snippets are designed for WooCommerce, and tested up to version 4.8.0.
They can be used by adding them to your functions.php file. I highly recommend using a child theme if this is your first time adding custom code!

Shortcodes
List all brands alphabetically with links
Add a list of Subcategories to any Category page
Functions
Add product page sections for each attribute
Change default WooCommerce Placeholder image
