# Best WooCommerce Snippets
A collection of WooCommerce PHP snippets written by me for adding more functionality to your online store. All of these snippets are designed for WooCommerce, and tested up to version 4.8.0.
They can be used by adding them to your functions.php file. I highly recommend using a child theme if this is your first time adding custom code!
